## 🧠 Project Overview

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on **IMDB movie reviews** to classify them as **Positive** or **Negative**.  
Two popular text vectorization techniques are compared:

✨ **Bag of Words (BoW)**  
✨ **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)**  

The goal is to understand how different text representations impact model performance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Convert raw movie reviews into numerical features  
- Apply **BoW** and **TF-IDF** vectorization  
- Train machine learning models for sentiment classification  
- Compare performance of both approaches  
- Analyze results and insights
